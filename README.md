This reposity is for my 2024 Calhoun summer dual enrollment class, Python Programming, or CIS 202.
This was a part of an assignment to create a repository on GitHub and I will be using this reposity to store all of my coding work throughout the course of the class.

What I have learned from each of these homework assignments:
BakeryLoopsHW-Calhoun-LandonGrove.py: I learned about while loops and break statements
DecisionStructuresHW-Calhoun-LandonGrove.py: Learned about decision structures, if, elif, and else
FunctionsHW-Calhoun-LandonGrove.py: Leanred about functions, global, and local
InputOutputHW1-LandonGrove.py: I learned how to take input, manipulate data, and output
InputOutputHW2-LandonGrove.py: I learned how to take input, manipulate data, and output
RevisedCallStacking-Calhoun-LandonGrove.py: I learned about call stacking and the orders in which functions will execute and print
